H«´fu√∞ ("man-head," Norwegian hoved, Danish hoved, Swedish huvud and Icelandic h√∂fu√∞) 
is the sword of Heimdallr.

"Where‚Äôs the sword? That sword is the key to opening the Bifrost." ‚Äï Hela

Hofund, often simply referred as the Bifrost Sword, was an Asgardian sword used 
by Heimdall and, during his exile, Skurge. 
It also served as a key to activate the switch that opens the Bifrost Bridge.
```

Compatible with Spring Boot >= 2.2.0 and Spring

### Requirements

You can check following requiremnts by running `mvn dependency:tree`, but if you are using `spring-boot` in version at
least `2.2.0` everthing should be alright.

Your project has to contain:

- spring-framework in version at least 5.2.12.RELEASE
- spring-boot in version at least 2.2.0
- micrometer-io in version at least 1.3.0
- slf4j in version at least 1.7.28

### Usage

#### SpringBoot based projects

1. Add to your pom.xml:

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>dev.logchange.hofund</groupId>
        <artifactId>hofund-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
        <version>0.1.0</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

2. Your project already contains SpringBoot Actuator with Micrometer:

```xml

<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
    </dependency>

    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
        <artifactId>micrometer-registry-prometheus</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

And your application has the following configuration:

```properties
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=prometheus
```

To define basic information about our application in hofund metric we need some configuration.
For maven project add to your `application.properties` following entries, but you can define it as you wish:

```properties
hofund.info.application.name=@project.name@
hofund.info.application.version=@project.version@
```

3. Now you can start your application and verify exposed prometheus metric, it should include (example for postgres
   datasource):

```text
# HELP hofund_info_status Basic information about application
# TYPE hofund_info_status gauge
hofund_info_status{application_name="cart",application_version="1.0.4-SNAPSHOT",id="cart",} 1.0
# HELP hofund_connection_status Current status of given connection
# TYPE hofund_connection_status gauge
hofund_connection_status{id="cart-cart-database",source="cart",target="cart",type="database",} 1.0
```

4. Currently supported spring datasource's for auto-detection and providing `hofund_connection_status`:
   - PostgreSQL
   - Oracle
